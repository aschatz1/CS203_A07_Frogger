My biggest struggle with this assignment was working with the BufferedImage import.  I tried to use a frog, dead frog, car,
and background, all of which I drew in Microsoft Paint (because I'm an amazing artist).

Instead of using BufferedImage, I drew my frog and cars within Java on top of a black background with a street.

The car's speed is based on your score instead of a timer.  The higher your score, the faster the car.

When you get to the other side, the frog resets at the original position of the screen.

When the frog intersects with either car, the game is over and you have to hit Enter again to restart.



P.S. I'm really not sure what's necessary for this assignment report.
